    punk rock,and hard rock. Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana fused pop
    melodies with noise. Billboard described their work as a "genius blend of
    Kurt Cobain's raspy voice and gnashing guitars, Dave Grohl's relentless drumming
    and Krist Novoselic's uniting bass-work that connected with fans in a hail of
    alternately melodic and hard-charging songs".</p>
